# Raster
Raster is my personal demo renderer. It uses Opengl 3.3, and renderers a cube that the user can orbit/zoom to look at.
# Building
## Requirements
- Cmake (3.20 or later)
- C compiler (C99 or later)
- Opengl graphics driver (3.3 or later)
## Cmake
Open command prompt in this source directory and run:
```
cmake -S . -B ./build
```
The project files will be in the newly created 'build' directory.
## Running
After compiling the project in the build directory, the output will be in the 'bin' directory.
